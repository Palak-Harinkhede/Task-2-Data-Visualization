# Task 2 – Data Visualization and Storytelling (Sales Analysis)

##  Overview
This project is part of a data analyst internship task focused on data visualization and storytelling.
Using the *Sample - Superstore* dataset, I created a Power BI dashboard that highlights key business insights through clean, impactful visuals.

##  Tools Used
- Power BI
- Dataset: Sample - Superstore.csv
  
##  Key Insights
- **Sub-Category Performance:** Copiers and Phones are profitable, while Chairs and Tables show losses despite high sales — suggesting cost or discount issues.
- **Yearly Trends:** Sales and profit steadily increased from 2015 to 2017, indicating business growth.
- **Regional Profitability:** States like Texas and Illinois report negative profits despite high sales — pointing to operational inefficiencies.
- **Customer Segment:** Corporate customers yield higher profit margins despite lower sales — making them a valuable target group.
- **Shipping Modes:** Same Day and First Class shipping show low or negative profit, highlighting the need for logistics optimization.
- **Discount Analysis:** High discounting often leads to lower or negative profit — indicating a need for better pricing strategy.
